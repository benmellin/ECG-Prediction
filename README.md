# ECG-Prediction
A final project in which we compared various machine learning models with a Bi-GRU neural network.

This was a group project in which our goal was to try correctly classify heartbeats from the [MIT-BIH Arrythmia Dataset](https://www.physionet.org/content/mitdb/1.0.0/).

My contributions to the project included experimenting with some [baseline machine learning models](Baseline.ipynb) and creating an [initial Bi-GRU model](BiGRU.ipynb).
